# Softlex Dental

Softlex Dental is a fork of [OpenDental 19.1](https://www.opendental.com) in which my goal is to simplify and modernize the OpenDental codebase by refactoring all existing code and removing functionality that adds unneeded complexity and bloat (such as themes and the ability to connect to the database using a middletier).
